// Micula / window.h
//
// A Windows 11 window: Mica behind it, Direct2D on top of DirectComposition, and no
// child controls at all.
//
// Why the composition path rather than an HWND render target
// ----------------------------------------------------------
// Because of Mica, and Mica is not a colour -- it is a *material DWM draws behind the
// window*, sampled from the desktop wallpaper. For any of it to be visible the window
// has to hand DWM pixels with alpha in them, and an `ID2D1HwndRenderTarget` cannot:
// HWND render targets are documented as supporting `D2D1_ALPHA_MODE_IGNORE` only, so
// every pixel it produces is opaque and the material is covered by whatever the page
// painted. The first version of this file used one, painted an opaque `#F3F3F3`, and
// looked like a themed dialog rather than like a Windows 11 application.
//
// So the window is composed instead, the same way WinUI 3 composes its own:
//
//   WS_EX_NOREDIRECTIONBITMAP    no redirection surface, so nothing opaque is
//                                allocated for the window at all
//   swap chain for composition   B8G8R8A8 with DXGI_ALPHA_MODE_PREMULTIPLIED
//   DirectComposition visual     the swap chain's content, targeted at the HWND
//   DWMWA_SYSTEMBACKDROP_TYPE    DWMSBT_MAINWINDOW -- Mica
//
// The cost, and it is not small: **`WS_EX_NOREDIRECTIONBITMAP` means child HWNDs do
// not render.** There is no redirection surface for USER32 to draw them into. So the
// text field that used to be a real EDIT control is gone, and widgets.h has a drawn
// one in its place with its own caret, clipboard and IME handling. That is a real
// regression in exactly one control and it is the price of the whole window looking
// native rather than nearly native.
//
// What happens on a machine without Mica
// --------------------------------------
// `DWMWA_SYSTEMBACKDROP_TYPE` arrived in Windows 11 22H2 (22621). On anything older
// DwmSetWindowAttribute returns an error, `micaActive` stays false, and the page
// paints an opaque background instead -- the window still composes, it just has a flat
// colour where the material would be. Checked rather than assumed, because Windows 10
// and the first Windows 11 release are machines this window still has to appear on.
//
// The title bar is drawn too, and it has to be
// --------------------------------------------
// The first version of this file left the caption to DWM, on the reasoning that DWM
// draws a good one and a hand-drawn caption is where snap layouts and the window menu
// go to die. That reasoning was sound and the result was wrong: on a machine with
// "show accent colour on title bars" switched on -- which is a default on many
// installs -- DWM paints the caption a flat accent colour, and **the backdrop stops at
// the bottom of it**. The window body showed Mica and had a solid brick-red bar across
// the top. Half a Mica window looks worse than none.
//
// So the caption is ours: `WM_NCCALCSIZE` gives the whole window to the client area,
// the material then covers every pixel, and the title, the icon and the three buttons
// are painted in the same pass as the page. What that costs is spelled out at each
// handler below, and the two things worth not losing are kept rather than
// reimplemented -- `WM_NCHITTEST` still answers `HTMAXBUTTON` over the maximise
// button, so Windows 11's snap-layout flyout appears on hover, and `HTCAPTION`
// everywhere else, so dragging, double-click-to-maximise and the right-click window
// menu are still DefWindowProc's job.
//
// No accessibility. Every control is drawn and none publishes a UI Automation
// provider, so a screen reader sees one window and nothing in it. This is the largest
// known gap in Micula and it is stated here rather than papered over: a program that
// must be usable without sight should offer the same operations another way -- a
// command line, a config file -- until this is closed.

    // to the next page" is a button that replaces the page the button is on. Clearing
    // the list there frees the `std::function` whose body is currently executing --
    // and MSVC reloads a lambda's captures out of that closure after every call the
    // body makes, so the `Invalidate()` such a handler ends with reads `this` back out
    // of freed memory.
    //
    // It is a crash exactly when that block has been reused in between, which is why
    // it reads as "the program usually dies on its busiest page" rather than as a fault
    // in any one page: the busiest page is the one whose layout allocates enough to take
    // the block back. Seen in the field as an access violation at `mov rax,[rbx+8]` --
    // the captured `this`, reloaded from the closure -- on the instruction after the
    // call to `Layout`.
    //
    // The comment over `OnClick` in `Proc` had half of this already: it stopped the
    // *window* touching a widget that a click had replaced. This is the other half,
    // which is the widget touching itself. So a widget replaced while a message is
    // being dispatched is moved here rather than deleted, and this list is emptied

//
// **Idle**: block in GetMessage, exactly as before. A settings window with nothing
// moving costs nothing, which is the state it is in for all but a few seconds of its
// life.
//
// **Animating**: drain the queue, draw one frame, and wait for the compositor's own
// clock. `DCompositionWaitForCompositorClock` returns when DWM is about to compose the
// next frame -- it is the same clock the window's visual is being composed against, so
// frames land one refresh apart by construction.
//
// What this replaces is a 16 ms WM_TIMER, and the replacement is not a preference.
// WM_TIMER is generated only when the queue is empty, is quantised to the system tick,
// and competes with the WM_PAINT it posts; measured over a page change and a scroll it
// produced gaps of 2 to 35 ms with a median of 24, which reads as stutter. Present()
// does not pace anything here either -- it was measured at 0.1 ms, because a flip-model
// composition swap chain with two buffers queues the frame and returns.
//
// The timeout is a backstop, not a cadence: if DWM ever stops ticking (it does not on
// Windows 11, but a remote session or a display going away can stall it), the loop
// keeps turning slowly rather than hanging with an animation half-finished.
//
// **Windows 10 has no compositor clock.** The function is build 22000 and later, and a
// static call binds it by ordinal (#1104) through the SDK's dcomp.lib; Windows 10's
// dcomp.dll has nothing in that slot, so the loader stops the process with
// STATUS_ORDINAL_NOT_FOUND (0xC0000138) before wWinMain -- no window, no message, not
// even the program's own "this needs Windows 11" if it has one. So it is resolved at
// run time. Without it the loop waits out the rest of one display refresh on a
// high-resolution waitable timer. Not Sleep(1): Present() returns in 0.1 ms here, so a
// 1 ms yield paces nothing and the window draws as fast as the GPU will queue frames.
