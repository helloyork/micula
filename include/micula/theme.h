//
// The colours, the metrics and the font stack, resolved from the machine rather
// than chosen here.
//
// Micula draws its own controls -- see window.h for why -- and the moment you
// do that you own every decision Windows used to make for you. Getting one of them
// wrong is not a cosmetic problem: a hardcoded white background on a machine set to
// dark mode is the difference between "this looks like part of Windows" and "this
// looks like something that got in". So every value below is either read from the
// system or taken from Microsoft's own published Fluent tokens, and the ones that
// are guessed say so.
//
// Three things come from the machine:
//
//   the theme     HKCU ... \Themes\Personalize\AppsUseLightTheme. Not the *system*
//                 theme (SystemUsesLightTheme) -- that one is the taskbar and the
//                 Start menu; apps follow AppsUseLightTheme, and a machine with a
//                 light taskbar and dark apps is a combination people actually run.
//   the accent    HKCU ... \Explorer\Accent\AccentPalette, which is eight RGBA
//                 entries from light to dark. Windows does not use the same one in
//                 both themes: a light window uses a darker shade so text on it
//                 stays legible, a dark window a lighter one. Using the raw accent
//                 in both is the most common way a third-party window looks slightly
//                 wrong without anybody being able to say why.
//   the DPI       per-monitor, per-window, and it changes while the window is open.
//                 Everything here is in DIPs; window.h sets the render target's DPI
//                 so Direct2D does the scaling, which is the only way to keep layout
//                 code free of a scale factor multiplied in by hand in forty places.
//
// No dependency on uxtheme, none on WinRT, nothing outside the Windows SDK. A program
// built with /MT runs on a machine that has installed nothing yet.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- motion

// Time, and what a control is allowed to do with it.
//
// **Everything here is Microsoft's published number, the same rule the palette above
// follows.** The first version of this was written from an impression of how Windows 11
// feels, and an impression is how a window ends up moving like something else: it
// cross-faded every state of every control, scaled buttons on press, and grew a text
// field's underline out of its centre -- which is Material Design's signature, not
// Fluent's. What WinUI actually does is narrower and is written down.
//
// Two mechanisms, because XAML has two and they behave differently:
//
//   **BrushTransition** -- a *linear* cross-fade of one brush into another over
//   ControlFasterAnimationDuration. This is what a Button's background does under the
//   pointer: `<ContentPresenter.BackgroundTransition><BrushTransition
//   Duration="0:0:0.083"/>`. Nothing else about the control moves -- the border and the
//   text are plain visual-state setters and change between two frames. `Ramp` below is
//   this, and the linearity is not an approximation: BrushTransition takes no easing.
//
//   **Storyboard** -- a duration and a KeySpline, for a control that is *going
//   somewhere*: the switch's knob, the expander's height, a flyout arriving, a page
//   arriving. `Track` below is this.
//
// Durations: WinUI's three published ThemeResources, in seconds.
// Easing: Fluent's own two curves, quoted as cubic-bezier from the design guidance --
// "Fast Out, Slow In" for anything entering or settling, "Slow Out, Fast In" for
// anything leaving. Both are extreme on purpose; that extremity is most of what makes
// Windows 11 feel quick rather than floaty.
//
// **Seconds, not frames**, and the clock is the compositor's -- see Window::Run. A
// per-tick increment (the toggle switch used to do `knob += 0.18f`) runs at whatever
// rate the message queue manages, which was measured at anything between 2 and 35 ms
